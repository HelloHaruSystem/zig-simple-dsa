# Zig DSA Practice

Practicing data structures and algorithms while getting comfortable with Zig syntax and memory management.

## Why?
- Practice Zig programming fundamentals
- Implement everything from scratch to understand the internals :)

## Topics to Cover

**Data Structures**
- [x] Arrays & Dynamic Arrays
- [x] Linked Lists
- [x] Ring Buffer
- [x] Stacks & Queues
- [x] Hash Map
- [ ] Binary Trees
- [ ] Heaps

**Algorithms**
- [x] Linear & Binary Search
- [ ] Sorting (Bubble, Merge, Quick)
- [ ] Tree Traversals (DFS, BFS)
- [ ] Basic Dynamic Programming

## Build the project
```bash
zig build
```

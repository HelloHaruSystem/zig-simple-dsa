# Data Structures TODO

## Prerequisites (needed as underlying structures)
- [ ] Dynamic Array
- [x] Ring Buffer

## Main Structures
- [ ] Stack (using dynamic array)
- [ ] Queue (using ring buffer)
- [ ] Hash Map (dynamic array of pointers to linked list heads)
- [ ] Deque (using doubly linked list)

## Potential improvements
- [ ] Merge Sort space complexity in linked lists (implement with pointer manipulation only)
- [ ] Ring buffer Push() method to not return overwritten value to make the API more intuitive
- [ ] Use std.meta.eql fir generic equality comparisons in data structures
- [ ] Make iterator implementations more Zig idiomatic
